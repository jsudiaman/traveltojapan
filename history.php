                    <p>Shinto and Buddhism are Japan's two major religions. They have been co-existing for
                        several centuries and have even complemented each other to a certain degree. Most Japanese
                        consider themselves Buddhist, Shintoist or both. Religion does not play a big role in the
                        everyday life of most Japanese people today. The average person typically follows the religious
                        rituals at ceremonies like birth, wedding and funerals, may visit a shrine of temple on New Year
                        and participates at local festivals (matsuri) most of which have a religious background.</P>

        <p>According to mythology, Japan's first Emperor Jimmu, a descendant of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, was enthroned
            in the year 660 BC. While the myths are not considered historically accurate, it is a commonly accepted fact
            that emperors have reigned over Japan for more than 1500 years, and that they have all descended from the
            same imperial family.</p>

                        consisted of
                        dozens of small independent states which were fighting each other and, for defense purposes,
                        were building small
