                        The custom has been strongly influenced by Zen Buddhism. Nowadays, the tea ceremony is a
                        relatively popular hobby. Tea ceremonies are held in traditional Japanese rooms in cultural
                        community centres or private houses. The ceremony itself consists of many rituals that have to
                        be learned by heart. Almost each hand movement is prescribed. Basically, the tea is first
                        prepared by the host, and then drunk by the guests. The tea is matcha green tea made of powdered
                        tea leaves.</p>

                        or historical event. Some festival are held over several days.

                        An important element of Japanese festivals are processions, in which the local shrine's kami
                        (Shinto deity) is carried through the town in mikoshi (palanquins). It is the only time of the
                        year when the kami leaves the shrine to be carried around town.

                        Many festivals also feature decorated floats (dashi), which are pulled through the town,
                        accompanied by drum and flute music by the people sitting on the floats. Every festival has its
                        own characteristics. While some festivals are calm and meditative, many are energetic and
                        noisy.</p>

                        the neighborhood sento or public bath was a place where the locals could
                        go to wash themselves, soak in a tub and socialize with neighbors.

                        Some sento, typically in hot spring resort towns, utilize natural hot spring water for their
                        baths. In this case they are considered an onsen bath. Public baths that are not supplied by hot
                        spring water, use heated tap water instead. With the exception of some theme park style bath
                        complexes, public baths are segregated by gender and swimsuits are not worn.</p>

                        commonly known. According to Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research "Whaling and whale cuisine
                        are part of Japanese culture", and Japan is the world's largest consumer of whale meat. The
                        Japanese diet consists principally of rice; fresh, lean seafood; and pickled or boiled
                        vegetables. The healthy Japanese diet is often believed to be related to the longevity of
